## Hash Tables Exercise

This exercise was completed by Student in Seattle in C16 and is included here for documentation: [https://github.com/AdaGold/hash-table-exercise/](https://github.com/AdaGold/hash-table-exercise/)

Given that this material is not likely to be seen in interviews or in industry, it's not recommended to complete it in the classroom portion. We may consider including during Thursdays at Ada.

The activity requires a bit of a lesson and introduction, provided here: [Hash Table exercise slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XrUcULhQMHhWNcEV5GJQSRPIHWgcnrXCVArrlUhuR0k/edit#slide=id.geec9359a67_0_224)
