# Object Oriented Design of a Linked List

### Encapsulation

When designing a data structure like a linked list, we typically want our design to include not just our linked nodes but also methods that operate on our linked list, such as methods to add nodes, delete nodes, or get the length of the linked list. Bundling together multiple pieces of data and methods that operate on that data is called __encapsulation__, and you may already be familiar with it in the form of classes. 

Encapsulation also enables us to design our data structure as __abstract__, meaning that the implementation of the data structure is hidden. This allows the internal implementation of the data structure to change without affecting user functionality. As a result, the designer could switch a linked list into an array list without the user needing to know. They could also transition from a singly linked list into a doubly linked list without impacting users. 

## Node Class

Because there is no built in data type that will store a piece of data alongside a reference to where the next piece of data is stored, we need to use a class to build our own. The `Node` class encapsulates each individual element of the linked list. It is comprised of an attribute that stores data and an attribute that stores a reference to the next node in the chain. A separate `LinkedList` class will be created later to allow us to store the head of our linked list. The rest of the list will be accessible via the head node.

```python
# Defines a node in a singly linked list
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.val = value
        self.next = None
```

Notice that with our implementation, the `next` attribute for a new node is set to `None` by default. This indicates that our node doesn't reference or link to another node. We can create a new node element by passing in the data we want to store to the `Node` class constructor as follows.

```python
node = Node(42)
```

![Linked List Node](images/node-linked-list.png)

We can update `new_node` to instead point at a second node by updating the value of its `next` attribute to reference the second node.

```python
node_two = Node(84)
node.next = node_two
```
![Two Linked List Nodes](images/two-nodes-singly-linked-list.png)

Similarly, we can update the value of a node by updating its `val` attribute.
```python
node.val = "cat"
```

## Modifying the Node Class

There is no reason our `Node` class can't contain attributes and/or methods other than `val` and `next`. 

<break>

For example, we might also track node indices with an `index` attribute or create a method to print out the value of a node.

In addition to the `value` and `next` attributes, nodes in a doubly linked list should also maintain a reference to the _previous_ node in the list.

You might also consider giving users the option to pass in a value for `next` and `prev`.

## LinkedList Class

Now that we have the `Node` class to represent individual elements of a linked list, we can create a `LinkedList` class to represent an entire list. The  `LinkedList` class has a single attribute `head` which stores a reference to the first node in the list. Our constructor initializes `head` to `None` so that when a new `LinkedList` instance is instantiated, we are creating an empty list.  

```python
# Defines the singly linked list
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

## Linked List Methods

Just as with standard Python lists, it is useful for the `LinkedList` class to also include several methods which allow users to perform operations on or pull information out of the linked list. Below we provide function stubs for several possible methods our class may have. Other `LinkedList` classes may choose to extend this functionality with additional methods. For example, the designer could add a `reverse` method to reverse the linked list or a `search` method to find the first element with a specified value in the linked list.

```py
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        # The first node in the linked list.
        # The head is either a Node object or None if the list is empty.
        self.head = None

    # Method. Adds a new node with the specific data value to the beginning of the linked list.
    def add_first(self, value):
        pass

    # Method. Returns the value in the first node in the linked list.
    # Returns None if the list is empty.
    def get_first(self):
        pass

    # Method. Returns the value of the last node in the linked list. Returns None if the list is empty.
    def get_last(self):
        pass

    # Method. Returns the value at a given index in the linked list.
    # Index count starts at 0.
    # Returns None if there are fewer nodes in the linked list than the index value.
    def get_at_index(self, index):
        pass
```

Abstraction allows us to use a class even if we don't know the details of how it is implemented. Simply having clearly documented properties and methods for the class available as detailed above is sufficient to use the linked list class.
