## Vocabulary and Synonyms

Below is a summary of vocab that we covered in this lesson.

| Vocab          | Definition                                                    | Synonyms  | How to Use in a Sentence                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linked List | A linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory.  Each element of the list contains a reference to the next element.     |       | "Because I wanted to add and remove elements to the front and rear, I used a linked list to store the data." |
| Tree      | A widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. |  | "I used a tree to store ordered data." |
| Binary Tree      | A tree structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the _left child_ and _right child_. |  | "A Mathematical expression can be written as a binary tree where the leaves are values and the parent nodes are operators like +, -, *, and /." |
| Binary Search Tree      | A specific type of Binary Tree which is a rooted binary tree data structure whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the nodeâ€™s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree. | Ordered Binary Tree | "Because 23 is less than the root, it can only be found in the left subtree of this binary search tree." |
| Leaf      | A node in a tree with no descendants. |  | "Because the left and right subtrees of the current node were `None`, this node is a leaf." |
| Parent      | A node with descendants. |  | "Because the left and right subtrees of the current node not `None`, this node is a parent and not a leaf." |
| Unbalanced Tree 	|  A BST where each node has 0 or 1 children (it looks like a linked list) 	| | The tree was unbalanced so inserting new values took linear time. |
| Balanced Tree 	| A tree where the the level of any two leaves differs by at most 1 node.	| | "Because my tree is balanced, it's quick to find values inside it."  |
| Subtree | The tree which is a child of a node. Note: The name emphasizes that everything which is a descendant of a tree node is a tree, too, and is a subset of the larger tree.| | "The value I'm looking for is less than the current node, so I will continue searching in the left subtree." |
| Traversal 	|  A method of visiting each node in a BST	| | "My method performs a traversal visiting each node in the tree, level-by-level." |
| Depth-First Traversal 	|  An algorithm for traversing or searching a tree. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.	| | A depth-first traversal looks like a mouse exploring a maze in that it goes as far down one path before backtracking when encountering dead ends. |
| Breadth-first traversal 	|  An algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. 	| | I printed out the tree level-by-level so I had to perform a breadth-first traversal. |
