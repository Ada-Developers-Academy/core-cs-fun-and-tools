# Lists As References

## Learning Goals

- Explain the impact of lists as references in a function call
- Identify functions with side effects
- Explain reasons to avoid side effects in our code

## Introduction

Lists are our first data structure.  As we saw in the last lesson a list is a more sophisticated data structure storing references to each element indirectly.  In this lesson we will look at some of the implications we need to keep in mind as developers.

## Vocabulary and Synonyms

| Vocab | Definition | Synonyms | How to Use in a Sentence
| --- | --- | --- | ---
|  Side Effect | Any lasting effect that occurs in a function, which is not through its return value. | - | A side-effect of our `find_product` function is that our list of products is put into alphabetical order. |
|  Mutable data type | Any type of variable which can be modified without changing the reference. | changable object | Lists and dictionaries can be modified inside function calls and so are mutable. |


## List As Arguments And Side-Effects

Integers and float variables cannot have side-effects when passed into a function as arguments.  Examine the example below:

```python
def calculate_total(subtotal, tax_rate):
    subtotal += subtotal * tax_rate
    return subtotal


products_total = 113

print(f"Before calculating the the total of the order, products_total is \
{products_total}")
bill_total = calculate_total(products_total, 0.08)
print(f"The total bill is {bill_total}")
print(f"After calculating the the total of the order, products_total is \
{products_total}")
```

While the function `calculate_total` is running both the parameter `subtotal` and the argument `products_total` both refer to the same value in memory.  

![Integer references from above](../assets/lists-and-memory/lists-and-memory_lists-as-references_int-references.png)

*Fig. A variable in Python contains a reference to the location where the data is stored.


**Question:** When the line: `subtotal += subtotal * tax_rate` executes, subtotal changes in value.  Why doesn't `products_total` change?

<details style="max-width: 700px; margin: auto;">
    <summary>
      Our answer        
    </summary>

Because any operation using the equals sign `=` including `+=` changes the _reference_ for `subtotal` to a new location in memory.  Essentially Python performs the calculation (addition in this case) and creates a new integer in memory to store the result.  

Python then makes `subtotal` refer to that new location, leaving `products_total` unchanged.
</details>

This is the kind of behavior we want, because we do not want our arguments to have their values changed unexpectedly.  Most of the time we will use return values to get information back from a function call.

When re-assigning an entire list, things work the same as for integers.  However when the elements _inside_ a list are modified things get interesting.

```python
def shorten_names(names):
    index = 0
    while index < len(names):
        # truncate the strings to 0-5 characters
        name = names[index]
        names[index] = name[0:5]
        index += 1

    return names


friends = ["Simpson", "Burns", "Hibbert", "Bouvier"]

print(f"Before the function call friends is {friends}")
shorten_names(friends)
print(f"After the function call friends is {friends}")
```

The output of this Python code is:

```
Before the function call friends is ['Simpson', 'Burns', 'Hibbert', 'Bouvier']
After the function call friends is ['Simps', 'Burns', 'Hibbe', 'Bouvi']
```

After the function call the list `friends` has been modified!

This is because both `friends` and `names` refer to the same list in memory.

![Diagram of `names` and `friends` in memory](../assets/lists-and-memory/lists-and-memory_lists-as-references_reference-example.png)

*Fig. Both `friends` and `names` refer to the same list in memory.*

Following the reference to the specific elements with `names[index] = name[0:5]` will follow the reference to the specific element and then change the internal reference to a new value.  For example when `index` is 0.

![Changing a reference at an index](../assets/lists-and-memory/lists-and-memory_lists-as-references_changing-index.png)

*Fig. Modifying an element in a list*


Notice that both `names` and `friends` refer to the same object, with updated items in the end.

Because list elements passed into a function can be modified during the function execution, lists are considered a _mutable_ data type.  Integers, strings and float arguments by contrast cannot have their values changed in a function call and are called _immutable data types_.

## Side Effect

When a function has an effect, like changing a variable, outside of it's return value, it is said to have a side-effect.

### !end-callout

## Problems With Side Effects

Functions with side effects like this can be quite useful for some situation, for example if we wanted to read in a name from the terminal and append it to a list argument.

However functions with side effects, especially when they are unintened or not communicated among the team can be very problematic.

*  Functions with side effects especially when it is unintended could lead to a lot of potential bugs which are harder to debug.
*  It is easier to write tests for functions with no side-effects.
*  If the function is supposed to change anything in the environment, like modifying a list parameter.  It must be clearly documented to avoid confusion.
*  Because of the above concerns writing a function with side effects requires a great deal more care and effort than a function without.

You can avoid introducing side effects by creating copies of mutable data types like lists and dictionaries and performing operations on the copies.

```python
def shorten_names(names):
    shortened_names = []
    for name in names:
        # truncate the strings to 0-5 characters
        shortened_names.append(name[0:5])
    
    return shortened_names
```

## Summary

Because lists internally contain references to the elements stored in them, it is possible for a parameter to modify the elements of a list passed as a parameter.  When this happens it is called a _side effect_.  Side effects can be useful, but they can also be problematic because they make our programs harder to test, and provide an avenue for subtle and hard to diagnose bugs enter our applications.  In general we try to avoid introducing side effects.
