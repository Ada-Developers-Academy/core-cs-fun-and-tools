# Instructor: Notes About Teaching Big O

- "Time and space complexity"
    - purpose: to introduce that time and space limitations are even worth considering, and how to consider them
    - totally reasonable to not spend time recording a video on it, it's good reading, and a lot of words
- "Big O notation"
    - purpose: teach how to read Big O, how to talk about it
    - purpose: emphasize that the rankings of Big O are worth memorizing (it is reasonable that they memorize O(1) is constant and fastest, etc)
- "Big O Analysis"
    - purpose: given an algorithm in code/pseudocode, how to analyze it's Big O
    - this is finally "the work"
    - A LOT more of this will be applied in the next set of lessons: Arrays
